## Cellular-Automata
This notebook demonstrates different learning rules for 2-D cellular automata. Conway's game of life is here of course, but also some less known rules.
Here are some examples to spook your interest:

### Conway's Game of life
This is a classical cellular automaton designed by John Conway. I choose to display pattern resultant from collision of 4 lines. It is a mixture of stability and chaos.

### Fredkin's rule
This curious rule creates replicas of the original pattern. Notice, how the image is most chaotic moments before the original pattern reapears.

### Seed's rule

This is a very chaotic cellular automaton.
