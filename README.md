### Cellular-Automata
This notebook demonstrates different learning rules for 2-D cellular automata. Conway's game of life is here of course, but also some less known rules.
Here are some images to spook your interest:

## Conway's Game of life
This is a classical cellular automaton designed by John Conway. I choose to display pattern resultant from collision of 4 lines. It is a mixture of stability and chaos.
